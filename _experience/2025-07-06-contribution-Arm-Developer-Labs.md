During my learning journey, I had the opportunity to contribute to **[Arm Developer Labs](https://github.com/arm-university/Arm-Developer-Labs-Staging)**, an open-source project focused on providing practical labs and learning resources for developers.  

My contribution involved working on **issues and improvements** within the repository, where I learned how large-scale projects are maintained and how collaboration happens in real-world open-source communities.  

### What I Learned
- How to navigate and contribute to a structured open-source repository.  
- Writing clean, consistent code and following contribution guidelines.  
- Reviewing issues, testing solutions, and submitting pull requests.  
- Communicating effectively with maintainers and the community.  

### Why It Matters
This experience gave me exposure to **real-world workflows** beyond personal projects and helped me build confidence in contributing to global developer communities. It also motivated me to create and maintain my own projects more professionally.
