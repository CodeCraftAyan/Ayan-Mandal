## Safety First: Hands-on with GeminiCLI & Model Armor for Security

I attended the **GDG Kolkata Pre-DevFest Workshop** in a spontaneous and fun way, a friend informed me about the session at the last moment, and I decided to join out of curiosity.

What started as a casual decision quickly turned into a highly engaging and insightful hands-on experience. The workshop focused on building **secure, responsible, and production-ready AI workflows** on Google Cloud, emphasizing the importance of integrating security early in the development lifecycle.

Through live demos and practical exercises, we explored how modern AI safety and security tools can be used to protect applications from prompt injection, insecure deployments, and container vulnerabilities.

### What I Learned

- **AI Prompt Security & Sanitisation**  
  Gained hands-on experience with **Model Armor on Vertex AI Workbench** to secure AI prompts and responses, reducing risks related to injection attacks and sensitive data exposure.

- **Secure Deployment & CI/CD Integration**  
  Learned how to use **GeminiCLI** alongside **Trivy** to automate container image vulnerability scanning on a Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM, ensuring safer deployments.

### Tools & Resources Used

- **GeminiCLI** – Managing AI workflows via command-line tools  
- **Model Armor** – AI safety and prompt protection on Google Cloud  
- **Trivy** – Automated container image vulnerability scanning  
- **rcedit (Electron)** – Editing Windows executable metadata during application packaging
