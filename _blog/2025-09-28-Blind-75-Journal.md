## Welcome to my Blind 75 Journey   

I’ve decided to take on the **Blind 75 Challenge** – a curated list of 75 essential coding problems designed to strengthen my **problem-solving skills** and prepare me for technical interviews.  

### My Challenge:  
- Solve **atleast one problem every day** until I become truly proficient in problem-solving.  
- Document my journey here – including both successes and struggles.  

This post will serve as a **living record** of my progress.

## Progress Tracker  

| Day | Date       | Problem Name        | Difficulty | Status    | Notes                               |
|-----|------------|---------------------|------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 1   | 2025-09-28 | Contains Duplicate  | Easy       | Solved | Explored brute force & optimized    |

## Daily Reflections  

Here’s where I’ll write about my **daily coding experiences**, what I struggled with, and what I learned.  

- **Day 1 (2025-09-28) – Contains Duplicate**  
  I managed to solve this problem on my second attempt using two nested loops. That worked, but it had **time complexity O(n²)** and **space complexity O(1)**.  
  Later, I learned better approaches:  

  1. **Brute Force** → Time: O(n²), Space: O(1)  
  2. **Sorting Approach** → Time: O(n log n), Space: O(1) or O(n)  
  3. **HashMap Approach** → Time: O(n), Space: O(n)  

  This helped me understand the importance of analyzing efficiency and not stopping at just a working solution.

## Goal  

By the end of this challenge, I want to:  
- Build **consistent problem-solving habits**.  
- Become comfortable with **arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, and trees**.   

This is just the beginning – let’s see where this journey takes me! ✨
