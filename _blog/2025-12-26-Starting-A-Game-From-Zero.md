## About This Project

I haven’t decided on a name for my game yet, and that’s okay.

Right now, what I *do* have is an idea and a story. That alone gives me enough confidence to start. This project is still at a very early stage, but it already feels meaningful to me, and I want to document the journey from the very beginning.

For the visual style, I’ve chosen **pixel art** for both the game’s look and its assets. The reason is simple and practical: I don’t have a powerful computer, I don’t own a dedicated GPU, and I’m working with almost **zero investment**. High-end 3D engines and heavy rendering pipelines aren’t realistic for me at the moment.  

2D development feels more approachable, more flexible, and better suited to the resources I currently have. Pixel art also fits well with the tone of the game I’m imagining, so it feels like a natural choice rather than a compromise.

As for the game engine, I chose **Godot**. It’s open-source, lightweight, and incredibly capable for 2D games. More importantly, it aligns with my goal of learning and building without relying on expensive tools or locked ecosystems.

This project is driven mainly by **inspiration and curiosity**. I don’t have everything planned out yet, and I don’t think I need to. Over time, I’ll share updates here as the idea evolves, the mechanics take shape, and the game slowly becomes something real.

If you’re reading this, thank you for taking the time to check out this early entry in my journey. I appreciate it more than you might think.
