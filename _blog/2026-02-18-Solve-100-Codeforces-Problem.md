Over the past 30 days, I challenged myself to solve **100 problems on Codeforces**, and it turned out to be one of the most rewarding learning experiences in my competitive programming journey.

This journey helped me strengthen my understanding of algorithms, improve my coding speed, and become more confident in tackling different types of problems. More importantly, it taught me the value of daily practice and persistence.

Each problem I solved contributed to better logical thinking and cleaner implementation, bringing me one step closer to my goal of becoming a stronger competitive programmer.

I will continue solving more problems and participating in contests to further improve my skills.
